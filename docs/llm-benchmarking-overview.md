# Wikipedia Citation Verification - LLM Benchmarking

## Overview

This document describes a benchmarking exercise conducted to evaluate the performance of various Large Language Models (LLMs) on the task of verifying Wikipedia citations, that is, determining whether claims in Wikipedia articles are supported by their cited sources.

## Motivation

Wikipedia's reliability depends on accurate citations. The [Wikipedia AI Source Verification tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Alaexis/AI_Source_Verification) uses AI to help editors verify that citations actually support the claims they're attached to. To understand which models perform best at this task, a systematic benchmark across multiple LLMs using real Wikipedia citations was conducted.

## Methodology

### Dataset Construction

The benchmark uses a ground truth dataset of 76 claim-citation pairs from Wikipedia articles. The articles were chosen semi-randomly from the author's areas of interest. 

- **Claim text**: The specific statement made in the Wikipedia article
- **Source text**: The content from the cited source
- **Ground truth verdict**: Human-verified classification of whether the source supports the claim

**Dataset**: [`benchmark/dataset.json`](benchmark/dataset.json)

The dataset was created using the following workflow:
1. Extract claim/source pairs from Wikipedia articles using `extract_dataset.js`
2. Manual review of the dataset to ensure accuracy (especially for citations that appear multiple times)
3. Verification that source content was accessible and usable

The dataset contains almost all of the sources that were available online for the articles in the sample. To balance the dataset, a few examples of citations that failed verification were added from the author's archives. See the [Appendix](#appendix-example-cases) for detailed examples of "Not Supported" cases.

### Evaluation Criteria

Claims were classified into three categories:

- **Supported**: The source clearly supports the claim with definitive statements
- **Partially supported**: The source only parts of the claim or uses hedged language
- **Not supported**: The source contradicts the claim or doesn't mention the asserted information

### Metrics

The following metrics were measured for each model:

- **Exact Accuracy**: Percentage of predictions that exactly match the ground truth
- **Lenient Accuracy**: Treats "Partially supported" and "Not supported" as equivalent (since both indicate citation problems requiring user action). Counts as correct: exact matches on "Supported", and either "Partially supported" OR "Not supported" when ground truth is one of those two.
- **Confidence Calibration**: Difference between average confidence on correct vs. incorrect predictions (higher is better)
- **Latency**: Average response time in milliseconds

**Full Results**: [`benchmark/results.json`](benchmark/results.json) | **Analysis**: [`benchmark/analysis.json`](benchmark/analysis.json)

### Test Configuration

All models were tested using:
- Temperature: 0.1 (for consistency)
- The same system prompt with detailed instructions and examples (can be found in [`main.js`](main.js))
- The same dataset of 76 entries
- API calls via PublicAI's free inference service (for open-source models) and Anthropic API (for Claude)

Four models were evaluated:

1. **Claude Sonnet 4.5** (`claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`)
   - Anthropic's frontier model
   - Tested via Anthropic API

2. **Qwen-SEA-LION-v4** (`aisingapore/Qwen-SEA-LION-v4-32B-IT`)
   - 32 billion parameter model from AI Singapore

## Analysis

### Key Findings

1. **Claude Sonnet 4.5 is the clear winner** with 75% exact accuracy and 76.3% lenient accuracy. It also has the best confidence calibration, showing much higher confidence when correct (86.9%) vs. incorrect (47.9%).

2. **Qwen-SEA-LION is the best open-source option** at 73.3% exact accuracy and 74.7% lenient accuracy, nearly matching Claude's performance. It's also the fastest of the reliable models (3,657ms).

3. **Apertus-70B is the most conservative** but has the lowest accuracy (57.3% exact, 60.0% lenient). It tends to over-classify claims as "Partially supported" when they should be "Supported" - a conservative approach that avoids false negatives but creates many false positives.

4. **OLMo-32B offers a balanced middle ground** with 66.7% accuracy/

### Pattern Analysis

**Supported vs. Partially Supported**:
- Apertus-70B frequently labeled "Supported" claims as "Partially supported" (24 out of 60 cases)
- This conservative approach creates many false positives, resulting in both lower exact accuracy (57.3%) and lower lenient accuracy (60.0%)
- Claude and Qwen were much better at distinguishing these categories

**False Negatives (missing problems - dangerous!)**:
These are cases where the model fails to detect citation issues, allowing unsupported claims to pass. Ground truth was "Partially supported" or "Not supported" but model predicted "Supported", or ground truth was "Not supported" but model predicted any level of support:
- Qwen-SEA-LION: 9 cases (6 Partial→Supported, 3 NotSupported→Supported/Partial)
- Claude Sonnet 4.5: 6 cases (4 Partial→Supported, 2 NotSupported→Supported/Partial)
- OLMo-32B: 6 cases (5 Partial→Supported, 1 NotSupported→Supported)
- Apertus-70B: 5 cases (3 Partial→Supported, 2 NotSupported→Partial)

**False Positives (overcautious)**:
These are cases where the model incorrectly flags good citations, potentially creating unnecessary work. Ground truth was "Supported" but model predicted "Partially supported" or "Not supported":
- Apertus-70B: 26 cases (24 Supported→Partial, 2 Supported→NotSupported)
- OLMo-32B: 11 cases (7 Supported→Partial, 4 Supported→NotSupported)
- Qwen-SEA-LION: 6 cases (4 Supported→Partial, 2 Supported→NotSupported - note: 2 were marked as unavailable)
- Claude Sonnet 4.5: 6 cases (5 Supported→Partial, 1 Supported→NotSupported)

**"Not Supported" Detection**:
- Claude marked 4 as "Source unavailable" when the source was in fact available. In the comments it reasoned correctly that the claim is not supported but somehow failed to classify them as "Not Supported"
- OLMo performed best on this category (3/5 correct)

**Confidence Calibration**:
- Claude has the best calibration (39.04 point gap), making it more trustworthy
- OLMo has strong calibration (43.2 point gap)
- Apertus has poor calibration (8.15 point gap), showing similar confidence whether right or wrong

### Reliability Considerations

- The models had excellent reliability with no more than 1 error each
- Response format compliance was excellent across all models

## Conclusions

### Best Overall: Claude Sonnet 4.5

For the Wikipedia citation verification task, **Claude Sonnet 4.5** is the clear winner:
- Highest exact accuracy (75.0%)
- Highest lenient accuracy (76.3%)
- Perfect reliability (0 errors out of 76)
- Best confidence calibration (models that know when they're right are more trustworthy)

### Best Open-Source: Qwen-SEA-LION-v4-32B

For users who need an open-source solution, **Qwen-SEA-LION-v4-32B** is the best choice:
- Nearly matches Claude's accuracy (73.3% vs 75%)
- Fastest response time among reliable models (3,657ms)
- Good confidence calibration (30.25)
- Excellent reliability (98.7%)

### Limitations

1. Dataset size (76 entries) is relatively small; more testing needed for statistical significance
2. Ground truth was created by human review, which may have its own biases
3. "Not Supported" is the rarest category (5 examples), making it hard to evaluate performance on this edge case

### Future Work

- Expand dataset to cover more Wikipedia articles across diverse topics (target: 500+ entries)
- Test additional models
- Add more "Not Supported" examples to better test false negative rates
- Analyze specific failure cases to improve prompting strategies
- Test impact of different temperature settings and prompt variations
- Evaluate cost-performance tradeoffs for production deployment

## Appendix: Example Cases

### Not Supported Examples

#### Example 1: Wrong Date/Event

**Article**: [Nasry Asfura](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nasry_Asfura&oldid=1330112057)

**Claim**: "The case continued until 15 December 2025, when the Supreme Court fully annulled all charges against Asfura and Cruz."

**Source**: El Heraldo article from June 1, 2021

**Why Not Supported**: The source describes a June 2021 appeals court decision to freeze criminal proceedings, not a December 2025 Supreme Court decision to annul charges. The date, court, and outcome are all different from the claim. This would be a tricky one for a human reviewer to notice!

**Model Performance**:

- OLMo-32B: ✓ Correctly identified as "Not supported"
- Apertus-70B: Marked as "Partially supported" (false negative)
- Qwen-SEA-LION: Marked as "Supported" (false negative)
- Claude Sonnet 4.5: Marked as "Source unavailable" but hit the nail on its head in the comment "the article discusses a different court ruling - it mentions the Sala Penal (Criminal Chamber) of the Supreme Court made a decision on 'este martes' (this Tuesday) to revoke a February 16, 2021 appellate court decision, but does not specify December 15, 2025 as the date. The source does not contain information about the specific date claimed in the Wikipedia article."

#### Example 2: Subtle Numerical Inaccuracy (Fooled 3 out of 4 Models)

This example illustrates a case where the cited source does not support the Wikipedia claim. Detecting these subtle inaccuracies is critical for maintaining Wikipedia's reliability.

**Article**: [First Chechen War](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=First_Chechen_War&oldid=1325376850)

**Claim**: "According to various estimates, the number of Chechens who are dead or missing is between 50,000 and 100,000."

**Source**: [Human Rights Violations in Chechnya](https://web.archive.org/web/20021228053504/http://www.hrvc.net/htmls/references.htm) (archived)

**Why Not Supported**: The source actually states: "for the period from 1994 to 2002 estimates range from **40,000 to 120,000 civilians**" - not 50,000 to 100,000. While the numbers are close, they are not the same. The claim's range (50K-100K) is narrower and shifted upward compared to the source's range (40K-120K).

**Model Performance**:
- Claude Sonnet 4.5: ✗ Marked as "Supported" with 85% confidence (false negative)
- Qwen-SEA-LION: ✗ Marked as "Supported" with 85% confidence (false negative)
- OLMo-32B: ✗ Marked as "Supported" with 80% confidence (false negative)
- Apertus-70B: ~ Marked as "Partially supported" with 80% confidence (still wrong, but closer)

**Key Insight**: This subtle numerical discrepancy fooled 3 out of 4 models. All three marked it as fully "Supported" despite the numbers being different. This type of error is particularly dangerous because:
1. The inaccuracy is subtle enough that it appears plausible
2. Models seem to treat "close enough" numbers as exact matches
3. High confidence scores (80-85%) suggest the models didn't detect any issue

**Note**: Prompt engineering could potentially help here. Adding explicit instructions to verify exact numerical ranges, dates, and statistics might improve detection of these subtle mismatches.

### Key Observations from "Not Supported" Detection

The rarest category in the dataset (only 5 examples out of 76), "Not Supported" was the hardest for all models to detect correctly:

- **OLMo-32B performed best**: 3/5 correct (60%)
- **Apertus-70B**: 2/5 correct (40%), marked 2 as "Partially supported" and 1 as "Source unavailable"
- **Qwen-SEA-LION**: 2/5 correct (40%), incorrectly marked 2 as "Supported" and 1 as "Partially supported"
- **Claude Sonnet 4.5**: 0/5 correct (0%), but interestingly marked 4 as "Source unavailable" - the model's reasoning in comments often correctly identified that claims weren't supported, but it chose the wrong category

This pattern suggests that models tend to be overly generous in their assessments, preferring to mark questionable citations as "Partially supported" or even "Supported" rather than "Not supported". This represents a significant risk for false negatives - allowing bad citations to remain on Wikipedia.
