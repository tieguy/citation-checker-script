## Project Overview

Wikipedia citation verification user script. An AI-powered sidebar tool that lets Wikipedia editors verify whether citations actually support the claims they're attached to. Users click citation numbers, the tool fetches source content via a CORS proxy, sends claim+source to an LLM, and displays a verdict (Supported / Partially Supported / Not Supported / Source Unavailable).

**Repository:** `alex-o-748/citation-checker-script`

## Architecture

- **Single class pattern:** `WikipediaSourceVerifier` in an IIFE wraps all functionality
- **No build system:** Pure ES6+ JavaScript loaded directly as a Wikipedia user script
- **Event-driven:** DOM event listeners and OOUI button callbacks
- **Provider abstraction:** Multiple AI providers (Claude, Gemini, OpenAI, PublicAI/Qwen/OLMo/Apertus) with unified interface
- **CORS proxy:** Source content fetched via `publicai-proxy.alaexis.workers.dev`
- **State:** Class instance variables; user preferences in `localStorage`

## Code Conventions

- `'use strict'` mode
- Class-based OOP with camelCase methods/properties
- Async/await for all API calls and async operations
- CSS-in-JS via `createStyles()` method (no external stylesheets)
- OOUI (OOjs UI) for buttons and dialogs, lazy-loaded via MediaWiki
- Error handling with try-catch; rate limiting with exponential backoff for 429s
- Inline comments for non-obvious logic

## Key Methods in main.js

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `constructor()` | Initialize providers, state, UI |
| `createUI()` / `createStyles()` | Build sidebar HTML and CSS |
| `createOOUIButtons()` | Provider selector, verify/report buttons |
| `attachReferenceClickHandlers()` | Handle citation [N] clicks |
| `extractClaimText()` | Extract claim text between adjacent citations |
| `fetchSourceContent()` | Fetch source via CORS proxy |
| `generateSystemPrompt()` / `generateUserPrompt()` | Build LLM prompts |
| `verifyClaim()` | Single citation verification flow |
| `callProviderAPI()` / `callProviderAPIGroup()` | Route to provider-specific API (single source / collective multi-source) |
| `verifyAllCitations()` | Batch verify all article citations |
| `verifyGroupCollective()` | Collective verdict for an adjacent-citation group (combines the group's sources into one LLM call; see `docs/design-plans/2026-06-23-collective-group-verification.md`) |
| `getReportUnits()` | Merge per-source results + collective group verdicts into one entry per claim (drives summary pills + exports) |
| `generateWikitextReport()` | Generate wiki markup for failed citations |

```

### Module system and shared logic

`benchmark/` is ESM (`"type": "module"` in `benchmark/package.json`) and imports `extractClaimText` from `../core/claim.js`. Editing claim-extraction logic in `core/` automatically affects both the userscript (`main.js`, via the sync script) and the benchmark — no second copy to keep in sync.

`benchmark/compare_results.js` and `benchmark/render_compare.js` are self-contained — they take already-loaded `results.json` / `dataset.json` shapes and don't import from `core/`. The `ccs compare` CLI in `cli/compare.js` is the file-IO layer that wires them up.

**Required environment variables:**
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Claude
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - OpenAI
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - Gemini
- `PUBLICAI_API_KEY` - PublicAI models

## Development Workflow

- **Tests:** `node --test` via `npm test` from the repo root, runs everything in `tests/**/*.test.js`. New helpers should get a sibling `*.test.js` file. Behavioral validation also goes through the benchmark suite against the human-labeled citation dataset.
- **No test/build CI** is wired up (the only GitHub Actions workflow is a scheduled talk-page scraper).
- **No linter** configured
- **Branching:** Feature branches off `main`, merged via pull requests
- **Deployment:** Deployed as a Wikipedia User Script (`User:Alaexis/AI_Source_Verification`) with USync for auto-updates

## Important Constraints

- `main.js` runs in the Wikipedia browser context — no Node.js APIs, no ES modules, no npm packages
- All external fetches must go through the CORS proxy
- OOUI components must be loaded via `mw.loader.using()` before use
- API keys are stored in `localStorage`, never hardcoded
- The system prompt contains 9 carefully tuned few-shot examples — changes affect benchmark accuracy
- Claim extraction uses "between citations" logic by design (not full sentences) for precision

### Benchmark row_id fragility (read before reordering the CSV)

`extract_dataset.js` derives each row's stable id as `row_<csv_line>`, where `csv_line` is the line number in `Benchmarking_data_Citations.csv` (`_rowIndex = index + 2`, accounting for the header). Two consequences a future regenerate must handle:

1. **Any CSV reorder shifts every id at or after the insertion point.** Inserting a row at line 50 shifts every row 50+ by +1 in `dataset.json`. Removing a blank/empty line does the same in reverse.
2. **`results.json` (and any other artifact storing `entry_id`) is NOT automatically remapped** when `dataset.json` is regenerated. The entries keep their old ids and silently misalign with the new dataset.

When you regenerate `dataset.json` after a CSV reorder, you must also walk `results.json` and update each entry's `entry_id` to the new value. The 2026-05-01 `a4973d7` regenerate caught the v3 +33 shift but missed a parallel −1 shift on the v1 rows around the v2 insertion boundary — the resulting misalignment was found two weeks later (rows 75/76/77 in `results.json` had content from what is now rows 74/75/76 in `dataset.json`). A content-based audit (match the entry's `comments` against current `claim_text` candidates) is reliable for catching this.

A stable-id refactor (content hash, or a CSV-supplied id column independent of line number) would eliminate the class of bug entirely.

### Dark mode has TWO independent paths — style every new UI element in both (read before touching CSS)

`createStyles()` in `main.js` supports dark mode through **two separate selector prefixes**, and a new element only looks right in dark mode if it gets overrides under *both*:

1. **`html.skin-theme-clientpref-night`** — the user explicitly picked Wikipedia's night theme. These rules live inline (search `skin-theme-clientpref-night`).
2. **`@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) { html.skin-theme-clientpref-os ... }`** — the user picked "follow OS" and the OS is dark. These rules live inside the `@media` block near the end of `createStyles()`.

The two blocks are hand-mirrored — there is no shared variable, so an override added to one is **not** inherited by the other. The recurring bug (e.g. grouped-citation blocks looking wrong in dark mode) is a new component that got light-mode CSS plus `-night` overrides but was never added to the `-os` `@media` block, so it stays light-on-light for every "follow OS" reader.

**Whenever you add or restyle a component with a non-transparent `background`, `border-color`, `color`, or `:hover` background, add matching overrides in BOTH dark blocks.** Don't forget `:hover` backgrounds — a light hover color (e.g. `#f0f4ff`) flashes jarringly over a dark card. Provider-tinted values should use `${this.getCurrentColor()}` rather than a hardcoded hex so they track the selected provider color (see the re-create-on-provider-change note near the bottom of `createStyles()`).

## Common Tasks

**Modifying the user script:** Edit `main.js` directly. Test by loading on Wikipedia via the browser console or user script page.

**Adding a new LLM provider:** Add provider config to `this.providers` in the constructor, implement a `callXxxAPI()` method, and add routing in `callProviderAPI()`.

**Updating the benchmark:** Edit `dataset.json` or re-extract with `npm run extract`, then run `npm run benchmark` and `npm run analyze`.

**Comparing two benchmark runs:** `npx ccs compare <control.json> <treatment.json> --dataset <dataset.json>` (or `npm run compare -- ...` from `benchmark/`). Emits JSON / Markdown / HTML with per-provider accuracy deltas and flip counts; supports subset filters and a `--noise-floor` threshold. See `docs/comparing-benchmark-runs.md`.

**Running tests:** `npm test` from the repo root. Tests use `node:test` + `node:assert/strict` and import the modules they cover directly — a script that runs work on import (e.g. `main()` at module load) needs to gate that behind `if (process.argv[1] === fileURLToPath(import.meta.url))` so importing it for tests doesn't trigger the runner. `extract_dataset.js` and `benchmark/run_benchmark.js` follow this pattern.
