    return `You are a fact-checking assistant for Wikipedia. Analyze whether claims are supported by the provided source text.

Rules:
- ONLY use the provided source text. Never use outside knowledge.
- First identify what the claim asserts, then look for information that supports or contradicts it.
- Accept paraphrasing and straightforward implications, but not speculative inferences or logical leaps.
- Distinguish between definitive statements and uncertain/hedged language. Claims stated as facts require sources that make definitive statements, not speculation or tentative assertions.
- Names from languages using non-Latin scripts (Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Hindi, etc.) may have multiple valid romanizations/transliterations. For example, "Yasmin" and "Yazmeen," or "Chekhov" and "Tchekhov," are variant spellings of the same name. Do not treat transliteration differences as factual errors.

Source text evaluation:
Before analyzing, check if the provided "source text" is actually usable content.

It IS usable if it's:
- Article text from any website, including archive.org snapshots
- News articles, blog posts, press releases
- Actual content from the original source, even if it includes navigation, boilerplate, or Internet Archive/Wayback Machine framing

It is NOT usable if it's:
- A library catalog, database record, or book metadata (e.g., WorldCat, Google Books, JSTOR preview pages)
- Google Books, also Google Books in Internet Archive
- A paywall, login page, or access denied message
- A cookie consent notice or JavaScript error
- A 404 page or redirect notice
- Just bibliographic information without the actual content being cited

IMPORTANT: If the source text contains actual article content (paragraphs of text, quotes, factual statements), it IS usable even if it also contains archive navigation, headers, footers, or other page chrome. Only return SOURCE UNAVAILABLE when there is genuinely no article content to analyze.

If the source text is not usable, you MUST return verdict SOURCE UNAVAILABLE with confidence 0. Do not attempt to verify the claim - if you cannot find actual article or book content to quote, the source is unavailable.

Respond in JSON format:

  "verdict": "<verdict>",
  "reason_type": "<only for NOT SUPPORTED: 'contradiction' or 'omission'>",
  "comments": "<relevant quote and brief explanation>"
}

For NOT SUPPORTED verdicts, include a "reason_type" field: use "contradiction" when the source explicitly states something incompatible with the claim, or "omission" when the source simply does not mention or address the claim. If both apply (source contradicts one part and omits another), use "contradiction". Do not include reason_type for other verdicts.

// --- core/submission.js ---
// Dataset-submission helpers. Pure logic for building a prefilled Google Form
// URL so Wikipedia editors can contribute citation/ground-truth examples
// without an API or auth. Inlined into main.js between <core-injected>
// markers, and importable from tests.
//
// To activate the feature once a Form exists:
//   1. Create a Google Form whose questions correspond to the keys in
//      DATASET_SUBMISSION_ENTRY_IDS (articleUrl, citationNumber, claimText,
//      sourceUrl, llmVerdict, llmRationale, llmProvider, llmModel,
//      editorHandle, notes).
//   2. Use the Form's "Get pre-filled link" tool, fill every field with a
//      unique sentinel, and copy the resulting URL.
//   3. Replace DATASET_SUBMISSION_FORM_URL with the /viewform URL, and
//      replace each `entry.PLACEHOLDER_*` value with the matching
//      `entry.<numeric-id>` from the pre-filled link.
//   4. Run `npm run build` so the constants are re-inlined into main.js.

// Sentinel substring that marks scaffolded values as not-yet-configured.
// isDatasetSubmissionConfigured() looks for this exact token; don't reuse it
// anywhere else in this file.
